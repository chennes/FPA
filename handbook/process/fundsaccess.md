## Overview

One of the main purposes of the FreeCAD Project Association is to collect money in support of FreeCAD, and disburse it as needed to further the project. The processes for doing so are described below.

## Small Expenditures

To speed the process of making small transactions, FPA Board Members are authorized to spend up to 100 USD without submitting the expense to a vote of the general membership. A General Member may request reimbursement of up to that amount from the board, who may approve it without a vote, or, at their discretion, ask for a vote of the General Membership. Larger amounts must be approved by a vote of the general membership.

## Large Expenditures

Funding for items over 100 USD must be put to a vote of the General Membership following the [standard FPA voting procedures](./process/voting). If the expenditure is approved, a Board Member (typically the Chair) will be assigned responsibility for disbursing the funds as directed by the vote, either as reimbursement for expenses incurred by an FPA member, or by directly paying the expense from an FPA account.
