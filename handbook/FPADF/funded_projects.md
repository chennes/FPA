## Funded Initiatives

The following is a reverse-chronological-order list of projects funded by the FreeCAD Project Association under the FPADF.

### Lei Zheng (@realthunder): Topological Naming Problem Mitigation

*Funding approved 15 November 2022.*

In recognition of the efforts he has put into FreeCAD, especially the very large time investment he has made in working with the FreeCAD Maintainers to integrate his work on the topological naming problem, Zheng is awarded a grant of 1000 USD.

### Ajinkya Dahale (@jnxd): Spline Handling in Sketcher

*Funding approved 26 September 2022.*

Ajinkya proposed numerous improvements to the spline handling in the sketcher workbench. He raised funds from many members to do this work and has largely completed stage one. The FPA contributed to the second stage which focused on functionality to create more interesting curves not possible by knot position and slopeÂ alone. In recognition of his significant contribution to FreeCAD, Dahale is awarded a grant of 1000 USD.
